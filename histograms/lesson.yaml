- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, you'll practice reading a histogram.
  
- Class: figure
  Output: "Look at this histogram of the exam scores in a course 
  with 123 students."
  Figure: hist4.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "How many students in this class had a score between 70 
  and 80 points in the exam?"
  AnswerChoices: 9;2;3;'7%';"Can't tell"
  CorrectAnswer: 9
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= '9')
  Hint: "multiply the proportion of area for the gray block 
  (15/(20+80+90+15)) by the total number of entries (123) in the list."
  
  
- Class: figure
  Output: "Now the block from 40 to 70 is missing!."
  Figure: histo0.R
  FigureType: new


- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Assume that the vertical scale is the density scale. 
  What is the hight of the missing block ? Choose the closest answer:"
  AnswerChoices: 0.17;0.21;5.00;6.00;"can't tell"
  CorrectAnswer: 0.17
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= '0.17')
  Hint: "Compute the percentage of area of the 3 blocks (20+60+15)
  and substract this number from the total 100 percent. Now that's the
  percentage represented by the missing block. Thus, the hight of the
  block must be (area/width) i.e. (100-95)/30"
