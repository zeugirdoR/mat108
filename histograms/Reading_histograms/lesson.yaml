- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, you'll practice reading a histogram.
  
- Class: figure
  Output: "Look at this histogram of the exam scores in a course 
  with 123 students. There is a vertical scale but that is strictly not
  necessary for the histogram to make sense. It is provided just to help with the
  relative hights of the blocks."
  Figure: hist4.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "How many students in this class had a score between 70 
  and 80 points in the exam?"
  AnswerChoices: 9;2;3;7%;"Can't tell"
  CorrectAnswer: 9
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= '9')
  Hint: "multiply the proportion of area for the gray block 
  (15/(20+80+90+15)) by the total number of entries (123) in the list."
  
  
- Class: figure
  Output: "Now here is another histogram. It is simmilar but not the same
  as the previous one. Besides, the block from 40 to 70 is missing!."
  Figure: histo0.R
  FigureType: new


- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Assume that the vertical scale is the density scale. 
  What is the hight of the missing block ? Choose the closest answer:"
  AnswerChoices: 0.17;0.21;5.00;6.00;"can't tell"
  CorrectAnswer: 0.17
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= '0.17')
  Hint: "Compute the percentage of area of the 3 blocks (20+60+15)
  and substract this number from the total 100 percent. Now that's the
  percentage represented by the missing block. Thus, the height of the
  block must be (area/width) i.e. (100-95)/30"
  

- Class: figure
  Output: "Look at the histogram of the yearly household incomes in a US town. The heights
  of the 4 blocks are, 8,2,0.4, and, 0.1"
  Figure: histo_incomes.R
  FigureType: new
  
  

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Using this histogram. What % of households in this town were used to
  build the gray block ?. Choose the closest answer."
  AnswerChoices: 18%;20%;10%;"can't tell";15%
  CorrectAnswer: 18%
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= '18%')
  Hint: "Compute the % of area of the gray block. Find the area of the gray block
  i.e., width*height (100) and divide this area by the total area under the histogram
  (560)."
  

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "What % of the households in this rich town have yearly incomes of more
  than 100 thousand dollars ?. Choose the closest answer."
  AnswerChoices: 11%;60%;10%;50%
  CorrectAnswer: 11%
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= '11%')
  Hint: "Compute the area of the blocks to the right of 100 ( that gives an area of 60)
  and divide by the total area under the histogram (that is 560). The answer is,
  0.1071 multiplied by 100% to get the answer in percentage points"
  
  

- Class: text_question
  Output: "Supose that we consider to be poor the households with yearly incomes
  of less than 10 thousand dollars. What % (rounded to the nearest integer) of
  households in this town are poor?. Enter your answer as number% like 9%"
  CorrectAnswer: 14%
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='14%')
  Hint: "It is the % of area in (1/5) of the first block. So, compute the area
  for the first block (400) and divide it by 5 (that gives you 80) and 80/560*100
  is the answer in percent."
  

- Class: text_question
  Output: "Using the same histogram. What percentage of the households in this town 
  have yearly incomes between $25000 and $120000 ?"
  CorrectAnswer: 55%
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='55%')
  Hint: "% of area of (1/2)*firstblock+secondblock+(1/5)*thirdblock. That is,
  (400/2+100+100*0.4/5)/560 multiplied by 100%"
